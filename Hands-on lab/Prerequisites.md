# Predictive Maintenance for remote field devices before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements (Provided Azure VM)

1. Microsoft Azure subscription (non-Microsoft subscription, must be a pay-as-you subscription).
2. [.NET Core 3.1](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
3. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) version 1.39 or greater
4. [C# Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.csharp)
5. [Azure Functions Core Tools version 2.x (using NPM or Chocolatey - see readme on GitHub repository)](https://github.com/Azure/azure-functions-core-tools)
6. [Azure Functions Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions)
7. An Azure Databricks cluster running Databricks Runtime 5.1 or above.
8. [Node.js 8.0 or above.](https://nodejs.org)

## Before the hands-on lab

### Task 1: Download the lab files

Open the Azure Portal with the provided account. Look for **LabVM-rg** resource group. Look for **LabVM** virtual machine, open and **Connect**. Download the RDP file and use the username/password provided to launch the Virtual Machine. 

From the machine, download the lab artifacts from GitHub.

1. In a web browser, navigate to the [LAB repository](https://github.com/unaihuete-org/AzureTecnun-IoT-1).

2. On the repo page, expand the **Code**, then select **Download ZIP**.

   ![Download .zip containing the repository](media/github-download-repo.png 'Download ZIP')

3. Unzip (right click > Extract all) the contents to your root hard drive (for example, Desktop folder). This will create a folder on your root drive named `AzureTecnun-IoT-1-main`.

### Task 2: Provision a resource group

In this task, you will create an Azure resource group for the resources used throughout this lab.

1. Log into the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. On the top-left corner of the portal, select the menu icon to display the menu.

    ![The portal menu icon is displayed.](media/portal-menu-icon.png "Menu icon")

3. In the left-hand menu, select **Resource Groups**.

4. At the top of the screen select the **Add** button.

   ![Add Resource Group Menu](media/add-resource-group-menu.png 'Resource Group Menu')

5. Create a new resource group with the name **Fabrikam_Oil**, ensure the proper subscription and **region nearest you are** selected. Then select **Review + Create**.

   ![Create Resource Group](media/create-resource-group.png 'Resource Group')

6. On the Summary blade, select **Create** to provision your resource group.

# OPTIONAL

### Task 3: Create an Azure Databricks service

Azure Databricks is used to train and deploy a machine learning model that predicts an oil pump failure, based on incoming telemetry.

1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Expand the left menu, and select **+ Create a resource**, type in "Azure Databricks" in the search field, then select **Azure Databricks** from the results.

   ![Azure Databricks is entered in the search field and Azure Databricks is selected.](media/azure-create-databricks-search.png 'Azure Databricks')

3. Select **Create** in the Azure Databricks details page.

4. Within the **Azure Databricks Service** form, complete the following:
